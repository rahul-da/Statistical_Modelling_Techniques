## LINEAR REGRESSION

here we try to find the best fit model for predicting the salary on the basis of given parameters in our dataset.

here step by step we refine our model and as you go through you can easily figure out that how we finally land up with a good model which we use on the test data set.

Linear Regression: y = f(x1,x2,â€¦,xn) where the model is assumed to be linear in each xi, with coefficients which are unknown and are the model parameters. Once we get the training data we estimate the parameters using the Least Squares Estimator.
